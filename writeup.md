**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## Rubric Points
#### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

###Camera Calibration

The code for this step is contained in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd code cells of the IPython notebook located in "./P4.ipynb". Â 

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

###Pipeline (single images)

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps are contained in cells 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the P4.ipynb IPython notebook).  

Here's an example of my output for this step.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `region_of_interest()`, which is located at the 10th cell of my notebook. That function strips out all the noise - sky, trees, etc - from the image, returnnig just the desired portion where the perspective transformation will be applied. 

Another function called `perspective_transform()`, which is located at the 11th cell of my notebook is also used for the perspective transformation. That function takes the original image as well as the matrix and distortion points we found earlier with the camera calibration (note that a 4th variable is passed to this function to indicate if the image should be plotted or not). This function creates the following source and destination points:

```
#define offsets
xfd=54
yf=450
offset=205

#get source points
src = np.float32([
        (offset, img.shape[0]),
        (xcenter - xfd, yf),
        (xcenter + xfd, yf),
        (img.shape[1] - offset, img.shape[0])])

#get destination points
dst = np.float32([
        (offset,img.shape[1]),
        (offset,0),
        (img.shape[0] - offset, 0),
        (img.shape[0] - offset, img.shape[1])])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 200, 720      | 205, 1280        | 
| 586, 450      | 205, 0      |
| 694, 450     | 515, 0      |
| 1075, 720      | 515, 1280        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

After applying calibration, thresholding and perspective transform, I had a binary image where the lane lines stand out clearly. To identify what pixels actually composed the lane lines, I used a histogram to verify what are the two most prominent peaks in the graph, which should indicate the x-position of the base of the lane lines. I then use a sliding window technique to search through the image starting from the x-position found by histogram to find and follow the lines up to the top of the frame. The code for the sliding window search is locate at the 13th cell of the notebook, on a function called `find_lines_pixel_position()` that takes the warped image as an argument. That function is called by another function (cell 14th of the notebook, called `draw_binary_lines()`, which takes the warped image as an argument), which, with the results of the `find_lines_pixel_position()` function creates a binary image with the lane lines identified highlighted by fitting the lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial.

The radius of curvature is calculated on the function called `find_curvature()` by converting the pixels of both the x and y coordinates to meters so it can be fit into the world space. This function is located on cell 15 of my notebook.

The position of the car related to the center of the image is calculated on cell 17 of my notebook, on a function called `draw_lanes_on_real_image()`. The postion is found by simply calculating the distance of the right/left lanes from the center of the picture. With that in hand I convert the pixel value into meters and fit it into the the world space.

The final result - lane area plotted back onto the real image with the curvature and position information - is located on cell 17 of my notebook. The function `draw_lanes_on_real_image()` takes the polynomial and lines arrays (ploty, left_fitx, right_fitx) as well as the matrix and distortion information and project those lines into the original image - aside of also calculating the position of the car related to the center of the image, as described above.

Here is an example of my result on a test image:

###Pipeline (video)

The pipeline for the video output is located on cell 20 of my notebook. I verified that my pipeline performs reasonably well on the entire project video.

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
