**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## Rubric Points
#### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

###Camera Calibration

The code for this step is contained in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd code cells of the IPython notebook located in "./P4.ipynb". Â 

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

###Pipeline (single images)

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:
![alt text][image2]

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps are contained in cells 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the P4.ipynb IPython notebook).  

Here's an example of my output for this step.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `region_of_interest()`, which is located at the 10th cell of my notebook. That function strips out all the noise - sky, trees, etc - from the image, returnnig just the desired portion where the perspective transformation will be applied. 

Another function called `perspective_transform()`, which is located at the 11th cell of my notebook is also used for the perspective transformation. That function takes the original image as well as the matrix and distortion points we found earlier with the camera calibration (note that a 4th variable is passed to this function to indicate if the image should be plotted or not). This function creates the following source and destination points:

```
#define offsets
xfd=54
yf=450
offset=205

#get source points
src = np.float32([
        (offset, img.shape[0]),
        (xcenter - xfd, yf),
        (xcenter + xfd, yf),
        (img.shape[1] - offset, img.shape[0])])

#get destination points
dst = np.float32([
        (offset,img.shape[1]),
        (offset,0),
        (img.shape[0] - offset, 0),
        (img.shape[0] - offset, img.shape[1])])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 200, 720      | 205, 1280        | 
| 586, 450      | 205, 0      |
| 694, 450     | 515, 0      |
| 1075, 720      | 515, 1280        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

After applying calibration, thresholding and perspective transform, I had a binary image where the lane lines stand out clearly. To identify what pixels actually composed the lane lines, I used a histogram to verify what are the two most prominent peaks in the graph, which should indicate the x-position of the base of the lane lines. I then use a sliding window technique to search through the image starting from the x-position found by histogram to find and follow the lines up to the top of the frame. The code for the sliding window search is locate at the 13th cell of the notebook, on a function called `find_lines_pixel_position()` that takes the warped image as an argument. That function is called by another function (cell 14th of the notebook, called `draw_binary_lines()`, which takes the warped image as an argument), which, with the results of the `find_lines_pixel_position()` function creates a binary image with the lane lines identified highlighted by fitting the lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial.

####5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

####6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

###Pipeline (video)

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
